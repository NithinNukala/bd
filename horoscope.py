    "Aquarius": "Your brain is a buzzing idea factory today. One of those ideas involves starting a podcast for pets‚Äîand honestly, it might just work. Let your weird brilliance shine and don't be afraid to wear mismatched socks; it‚Äôs part of the creative process.",
    
    "Pisces": "You‚Äôre riding a wave of dreamy vibes today. Don‚Äôt be surprised if you start a deep conversation with your houseplant or write a poem about cereal. Your imagination is a gift‚Äîjust maybe avoid adopting another imaginary pet (you‚Äôre already booked).",
    
    "Aries": "Energy: high. Patience: low. Passion: maximum. You‚Äôre ready to conquer the world‚Äîor at least your laundry pile. If someone challenges you to a game of rock-paper-scissors today, go full champion mode. Victory is practically written in the stars.",
    
    "Taurus": "Comfort is your superpower today. Your couch has never looked more inviting, and snacks taste 30% better than usual. It‚Äôs okay to indulge‚Äîluxury is a mindset, and you're living your best cozy life like a soft blanket in human form.",
    
    "Gemini": "Your thoughts are bouncing around like popcorn in a microwave. You‚Äôll start five conversations, invent three nicknames, and somehow get very passionate about penguins. Embrace the chaos‚Äîyou‚Äôre charming, unpredictable, and probably late for something.",
    
    "Cancer": "Today you‚Äôre in full nurturing mode‚Äîyou might bake cookies for your neighbors, give advice to a squirrel, or cry during a detergent commercial. Your heart is huge and your vibes are warm enough to toast marshmallows.",
    
    "Leo": "You‚Äôre the main character today, and the universe is your spotlight. Expect compliments, dramatic hair flips, and at least one slow-motion walk. Even your coffee cup wants your autograph. Own it‚Äîyou‚Äôre fabulous and you know it.",
    
    "Virgo": "You woke up ready to fix things‚Äîtypos, crooked paintings, possibly the economy. While others are winging it, you‚Äôre out here with a spreadsheet and a mission. Just don‚Äôt forget to have fun‚Äîperfection is cool, but confetti is cooler.",
    
    "Libra": "You‚Äôll be caught in an intense decision today: pancakes or waffles? Just know that whatever you choose, your taste is flawless. You‚Äôre radiating charm, grace, and a strong desire to rearrange your furniture for ‚Äúaesthetic balance.‚Äù",
    
    "Scorpio": "Today your aura is mysterious‚Ä¶ mostly because you forgot where you put your keys. Still, your intense vibe will have people wondering if you‚Äôre a superhero in disguise. Keep them guessing‚Äîand maybe check your coat pockets again.",
    
    "Sagittarius": "Adventure is calling‚Äîbut so is your bed. Today, you‚Äôll explore bold new frontiers like trying a weird flavor of chips or watching a documentary about goats. Life is exciting when you‚Äôre curious, caffeinated, and slightly impulsive."
